This code  basicallly sets up a basic CRUD API for managing tasks. 
The code  uses the Gin framework for handling HTTP requests and responses.
The tasks are stored in a slice ([]Task) in memory, so they will be lost when the server is restarted.
In a real-world application,a database must be set up for persistent storage.
You can test the API using tools like cURL or Postman.
